## Amplify Costs & Pricing Overview

Amplify is an **open-source platform**, meaning there are no licensing fees to use it. However, users must cover costs associated with **hosting** and **AI token** usage based on the cloud provider and AI models.

### Estimating Costs

Please Note: the minimum cost associated with hosting an instance of Amplify with no usage is ~$250/mo. This is due to the fact that there are some provisioned resources in AWS do not scale completely to zero, and there is some cost associated with keeping the instance alive.

* Hosting Costs:
  * Users are responsible for paying for AWS costs associated with hosting Amplify.
  * Cost may vary based on usage and configuration.
* AI Token Usage Costs:
  * Amplify connects to AI models that charge per 1,000 input and output tokens (a token is approximately 4 characters of text).
  * Costs depend on the AI model used in your conversations.

#### Monitoring & Managing Costs
To avoid unexpected expenses, follow these best practices:

* âœ” Set up cost alerts in AWS, OpenAI, or Azure.
* âœ” Monitor token usage in your providerâ€™s billing dashboard.
* âœ” Use lower-cost models (e.g., Claude Instant, GPT-3.5) when applicable.
* âœ” Enable spending caps to control monthly costs.

### Next Steps
Once billing is set up, you can integrate your API key with Amplify to start using AI-powered features

## In Depth Deployment Steps

These are the deployment instructions to deploy Amplify-GenAI in your own AWS environment. This deployment will create many resources in your account. Please be aware that there are costs associated with deploying the following application.

### 1. Clone Repositories

- Clone all three repositories (`amplify-genai-frontend`, `amplify-genai-backend`, and `amplify-genai-iac`) from `https://github.com/gaiin-platform` into the same directory on your local machine.

### 2. Terraform Initialization and Application

- Navigate to the `amplify-genai-iac` project on your local machine.
- Configure the Terraform variables by copying the `amplify-genai-iac/<env>/terraform.tfvars_sample` file to `amplify-genai-iac/<env>/terraform.tfvars`.
- Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with the specific values for your deployment. You will need to configure the following variables:
  - Load balancing vars: `public_subnet_cidrs`, `private_subnet_cidrs`, `alb_name`, `domain_name`, `app_route53_zone_id`
  - Cognito vars: `cognito_domain`, `cognito_route53_zone_id`
  - ECS vars: `ecs_alarm_email`
- If this is the first time you are deploying, initialize your Terraform environment by running `terraform init`.
- Apply your Terraform configuration using `terraform apply`. Occassionally, you will see an "access denied" error when trying to apply a policy to a resource. You may need to run `terraform apply` again to correct this issue.

### 3. Configure Serverless Framework Variables

- After applying Terraform configurations, save the outputs from the Terraform state. These will be used in the variables needed for the Serverless Framework deployment.
- Create and configure a `amplify-genai-backend/var/<env>-var.yml` file using the values from the Terraform outputs. Use `amplify-genai-backend/<env>-var.yml-example` as a reference for the required format and variables. You will need to configure all variables in the `amplify-lambda` section. The reference sample includes comments to denote which variable from the Terraform outputs are to be used.

### 4. Backend Package Installation

- Install the necessary Serverless plugins by running the following commands in the `amplify-genai-backend` directory:

  ```sh
  npm install 
  ```


- For the JavaScript dependencies, navigate to the `amplify-genai-backend/amplify-lambda-js` directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary Node.js packages.

### 5. Deploy Serverless Backend Services

- To deploy the Python 3.11 backend services using the Serverless Framework, navigate to the `amplify-genai-backend` directory.
- Deploy all backend lambdas by running the following commands:

  ```sh

  serverless deploy --stage <env>

  ```

- If an individual service fails to deploy, and you cannot resolve the issue through the Serverless Framework, you may need to manually delete the associated CloudFormation stack from the AWS console before retrying the deployment.
- To deploy an individual service, execute:

  ```sh
 
  serverless <service-name>:deploy --stage <env>

  ```

- where `service-name` is the specific service key as defined in `serverless-compose.yml`.


### 6. Update Task Definition and Apply Terraform Configuration

After deploying the backend services, you will need to update certain variables in your Terraform (IAC) configuration:

- Obtain the following environment specific (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) variables from the deployed backend services and AWS Console:
  - `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for your API endpoints. This should be the custom API domain within the API gateway console.
  - `CHAT_ENDPOINT`: The exported variable from the `amplify-js-<env>`` CloudFormation stack.
  - `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`: Found in the App Client settings within the Cognito console on AWS.
  - `COGNITO_ISSUER`: The base URL for your Cognito user pool, found in the Cognito console on AWS.
  - `COGNITO_DOMAIN`: The custom Cognito domain, found in the App integration tab of the Cognito console on AWS.

- Update the `amplify-genai-iac/<env>/terraform.tfvars` file with the newly obtained values for the respective variables.

- Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running `terraform apply` within the `amplify-genai-iac/<env>` project directory.

Additionally, certain secrets must be updated manually in the AWS Secrets Manager or via AWS CLI:

- Navigate to the AWS Secrets Manager and locate the secret named `amplify-app-secrets`.
- Manually update the following secret values:
  - `COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET`: Can be found in the App Client settings within the Cognito console in AWS.
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate a new random secret for NextAuth.
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Insert your OpenAI API Key.

### 7. Build and Deploy to ECR

- To build the container and deploy it to the service, follow these steps:
  - Authenticate to Amazon ECR using the AWS CLI. (For steps, visit Amazon ECR in the AWS Management Console, select the private repository, and click `View Push Commands`.)
  - Build the Docker image from the Frontend Repository directory using this command: 

    ```sh
    docker build -t <env>-<ecr_repo_name> .
    ```

  Replace `env` with the deployment environment, and `ecr_repo_name` is the name given in the `amplify-genai-iac/<env>/terraform.tfvars` file.

  - Tag the Docker image with the `latest` tag and a unique tag that includes the date and SHA digest of the image.
  - Push the Docker image to the Amazon ECR repository with the `docker push` command.
  - Update the ECS service to use the new Docker image by forcing a new deployment with the AWS CLI or via the AWS Management Console.

### 8. Configure S3, Secrets, and Azure Endpoints

- Upload the `amplify-genai-backend/misc_deployment_files/base.json` file to the `amplify-<deployment>-lambda-<env>-base-prompts` S3 bucket.
- Configure the `amplify-genai-backend/misc_deployment_files/endpoints.json` file with your Azure endpoints and associated keys. Update the AWS Secrets Manager secret titled `<env>-openai-endpoints`.

### 9. Clean Up

- After the deployment, remove any temporary files or secrets that were created during the process. This includes any local configuration files or sensitive information that should not be stored permanently.

## Notes

- Throughout the deployment process, ensure that you are in the correct directories when executing commands.
- Always verify the output of each command to ensure that there are no errors before proceeding to the next step.
- The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` can be an arbitrary string.
- It is recommended to document the values of important variables and outputs for future reference and troubleshooting.
- Below are the currently supported models that Amplify can use. 
  
  #### Anthropic (via Amazon Bedrock)
    - `anthropic.claude-instant-v1`
    - `anthropic.claude-v2:1`
    - `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0` This models use the Bedrock Inference Endpoints. Refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html "Bedrock Inference Regions") and deploy in the appropriate regions.
    - `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`
    - `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`
    - `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0` This models use the Bedrock Inference Endpoints. Refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html "Bedrock Inference Regions") and deploy in the appropriate regions. 
    - `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`
    - `us.anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0` This models use the Bedrock Inference Endpoints. Refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html "Bedrock Inference Regions") and deploy in the appropriate regions.
  

  #### OpenAI (via OpenAI or Azure)
    - `gpt-35-turbo`
    - `gpt-4o`
    - `gpt-4-1106-Preview`
  
  #### Mistral (via Amazon Bedrock)
    - `mistral.mistral-7b-instruct-v0:2`
    - `mistral.mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1`
    - `mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0`

  Populate `AVAILABLE_MODELS` with a comma-delimited list of the supported models you wish to make available. To use the Anthropic or Mistral models, you will need to enable them in your AWS account and then update the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` environment variable in the `amplify-genai-iac` project and run `terraform apply`. For Bedrock models, please ensure you have requested access in the appropriate regions. 

  Example:
  ```
  AVAILABLE_MODELS='gpt-35-turbo,gpt-4o,gpt-4-1106-Preview,anthropic.claude-instant-v1,anthropic.claude-v2:1,anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0,anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0,anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0,anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0,mistral.mistral-7b-instruct-v0:2,mistral.mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1,mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0'
  ```

  After the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` environment variable has been updated, you will need to redeploy the AWS ECS service.
